Powered by [cleverbot](http://www.cleverbot.com/).\r\n\r\n###Battle Mode:\r\n\tDescription: The bot will allow a battle list to be built, where users can add themselves. The users face off 1v1 with the designated amount of \"rounds\" or songs. A voting window will open up with 30 seconds left for each song played. The dj with the most votes counted is the winner.\r\n\r\n\tCommands:\r\n\t/add,\r\n\t/remove,\r\n\t/list,\r\n\t+1\r\n\r\n###Autodj Mode:\r\n\tDescription: When the bot notices there are only two djs or less, it will hop up on stage to dj.\r\n\r\n###Solo Mode:\r\n\tDescription: The bot will stay on deck with an individual and skip itself on it's turn, so someone can dj with themselves. Once a 3rd dj hops up, solo mode is deactivated.\r\n\r\n##Afk Mode,\r\n\tDescription: Afk watch starts when a user enters the room, with the designated time limit given to them to stay active. This time is constantly draining against them, every second. Once a user chats, votes, snags or hops up to dj their afklimit is refreshed. If a user does not do any of these activities, the bot will consider and mark you afk(away from keyboard). If you are on deck and afk, you will be given the designated time to return before being removed from the stage. When you are afk & in queue waitlist, you will be skipped one your turn.\r\n\r\n###Tweet Mode:\r\n\tDescription: The bot will tweet various designated messages when new songs are playing, including the current song and room information.\r\n\r\n###Announce Mode,\r\n\tDescription: The bot will announce when a user downvotes a currently playing song, will greet a user when they enter the room, will announce song stats at the end of each play and will show an emoji when it is dancing.\r\n\r\n###Game Mode:\r\n\tDescription: Various game type features will be toggled that usually are called \"spam\", appropriately.
